# Switching tabs in the landing
---

An example of solving a problem for a one-page site when you need to implement the functional part of switching tabs on JS

- The siteâ€™s layout was not done by me, the styles too.
 - all the functionality in the script.js file
 - there are comments in Russian (for beginners) in previous commits.
- in the last commit, all comments are deleted (for the purity of the code).
